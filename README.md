# Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Amali Abeysekera

Hi, I'm a final year BIT undergraduate at UCSC. Over the past 3+ years, Iâ€™ve worked across diverse sectors including Banking and Business Process Outsourcing (BPO), which has allowed me to collaborate with multicultural teams and develop a strong foundation in professional communication, adaptability, and teamwork.

My journey so far has helped me grow both personally and professionally, while reinforcing my passion for working in dynamic, fast-paced environments.

I am currently learning React and Tailwind CSS to create beautiful web applications.
